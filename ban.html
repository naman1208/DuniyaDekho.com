Bangalore  is the capital city of the Indian state of Karnataka. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the
 south-eastern part of Karnataka. Bangalore is India's third most populous city and fifth-most 
populous urban agglomeration. Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India because 
of its position as the nation's leading Information technology (IT) exporter.Located at a height of over
 3,000 feet (914.4 m) above sea level, Bangalore is known for its pleasant climate throughout the year. The city is amongst the top ten preferred entrepreneurial locations in the world.[11]
A succession of South Indian dynasties, the Western Gangas, the Cholas, and the Hoysalas ruled the 
present region of Bangalore until in 1537 CE, Kempé Gowda — a feudatory ruler under the Vijayanagara
 Empire — established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore. Following 
transitory occupation by the Marathas and Mughals, the city remained under the Mysore Kingdom.
 It later passed into the hands of Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, and was captured by the British
 after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative control of the city 
to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore, and was 
made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British
 Raj. In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew
 up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following India's independence in 1947, 
Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when the new Indian state of 
Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore — City and Cantonment — which
 had developed as independent entities merged
 into a single urban centre in 1949. The city was 
renamed Bengaluru in 2006.
