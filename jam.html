Jammu and Kashmir is a state of India. It is located mostly in the Himalayan mountains
 and shares a border with the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south.
 Jammu and Kashmir has an international border with the People's Republic of China in
 the north and east while Line of Control separates it from Pakistani controlled territories 
of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan in the west and northwest respectively.
Formerly a part of the erstwhile Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu, which governed the 
larger historic region of Kashmir, this territory is disputed among China, India and Pakistan. 
Pakistan, which claims the territory as disputed, refers to it alternatively as Indian-occupied Kashmir
 or Indian-held Kashmir, while some international agencies such as the United Nations call it Indian-
administered Kashmir. The regions under the control of Pakistan are referred to as Pakistan
-occupied Kashmir or PoK within India, as "Azad" Jammu and Kashmir in Pakistan, 
and as Pakistan-administered Kashmir or Pakistan-controlled Kashmir generally.
Jammu and Kashmir consists of three regions: Jammu, the Kashmir valley and Ladakh. 
Srinagar is the summer capital, and Jammu is the winter capital. While the Kashmir valley 
is famous for its beautiful mountainous landscape, Jammu's numerous shrines attract tens of 
thousands of Hindu pilgrims every year. Ladakh, also known as "Little Tibet", is renowned for its 
remote mountain beauty and Buddhist culture.
