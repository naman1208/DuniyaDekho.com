The Dubai Mall is the world's largest shopping mall based on total area and sixth largest by gross leasable area.[citation needed] Located inDubai, United Arab Emirates (U.A.E), it is part of the 20-billion-dollar Downtown Dubai complex, and 
includes 1,200 shops.Access to the mall is provided via Doha Street, rebuilt as a double-decker road in April 2009.
However it is not the largest in gross leasable space, and is surpassed in that category by several
 malls including the South China Mall, which is the world's largest, Golden Resources Mall, SM City North Edsa, and SM Mall of Asia.
It attracted more visitors than New York City with over 52 million tourists in 2012, and Los Angeles with 41 million. The numbers also 
surpass visitor arrivals to all landmark leisure destinations and theme parks in the world including Times Square (39.2 million), Central Park (38 million), and Niagara Falls (22.5 million).
