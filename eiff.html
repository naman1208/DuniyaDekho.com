The Eiffel Tower (French: La Tour Eiffel, [tu? ?f?l]) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the1889 World's Fair, it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.The tower is the tallest structure in Parisand the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.98 million people ascended it in 2011.The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010.
The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall,about the same height as an 81-storey building. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monumentto assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Because of the addition of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Not including broadcast antennae, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct.
