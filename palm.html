The Palm Jumeirah is an artificial archipelago created using land reclamation by Nakheel, a company
owned by the Dubai government in United Arab Emirates and was designed and developed by HHCP architects. It is one of three planned
 islands called the Palm Islands(Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira) which would have extended into the Persian Gulf, increasing Dubai's shoreline by a total of 520 kilometres (320 mi). The Palm Jumeirah is the smallest and
 the original of three Palm Islands originally under development byNakheel. It is located on the Jumeirah coastal area of the emirate of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Palm Jumeirah is in the shape of a palm tree. It consists
 of a trunk, a crown with 17 fronds, and a surrounding crescent island that forms an 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) long breakwater. </div>
