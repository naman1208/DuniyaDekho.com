Assam , is a northeastern state of India. Its capital is Dispur, located within the municipal area 
of Guwahati city. Located south of the eastern Himalayas, Assam comprises the Brahmaputra and
 the Barak river valleys along with the Karbi Anglong and the North Cachar Hills with an area of 
30,285 square miles (78,438 km²). Assam is surrounded by six of the other Seven Sister States: 
Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya. Geographically Assam
 and these states are connected to the rest of India via a narrow strip of land in West Bengal called 
the Siliguri Corridor or "Chicken's Neck".
Assam shares international borders with Bhutan and Bangladesh; and cultures, peoples and climate
 with South-East Asia – important elements in India’s Look East policy. Assam became a part of the 
British India after the British occupied the region following the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824–1826.
Assam is rich in culture, ethnic groups, languages/dialacts spoken and literature. 
It is known for Assam tea, large and old petroleum resources (the first oil reserves of India were 
discovered in Assam in the late 19th century), Assam silk and for its rich biodiversity. Assam has 
successfully conserved the one-horned Indian rhinoceros from near extinction, along with the tiger
 and numerous species of birds, and it provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. 
It is becoming an increasingly popular destination for wildlife tourism, and Kaziranga and Manas 
are both World Heritage Sites. Assam was also known for its Sal tree forests and forest products, 
much depleted now. A land of high rainfall, Assam is endowed with lush greenery and the mighty 
river Brahmaputra, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with a unique hydro-
geomorphic and aesthetic environment.
