Agra , the former capital of Hindustan, is a city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of 
Uttar Pradesh, India. 
It is 363 kilometres (226 mi) west of the state capital, Lucknow, and 200 kilometres (124 mi) south of the 
national capital New Delhi. With a population of 1,686,976 (2010 est.), it is one of the most populous cities in
 Uttar Pradesh and the 19th most populous in India.
[2] Agra can also refer to the administrative district that has its headquarters in Agra city.
 It is a major tourist destination because of its many splendid Mughal-era buildings, most notably the 
Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all three of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
 Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur.
The city is mentioned in the epic Mahabharata, 
where it was called Agrevata ("the border of the 
forest").Legend ascribes the founding of the city to Raja Badal Singh
, a Sikarwar Rajput king (c. 1475), whose fort,
 Badalgarh, stood on or near the site of the present
 fort. However, the 11th century Persian poet Mas'd
 Sa'd Salman writes of a desperate assault on the 
fortress of Agra, then held by the Shaha King 
Jayapala, by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. Sultan
 Sikandar Lodhi was the first to move his capital 
from Delhi to Agra in 2506. He died in 1517 and his 
son, Ibrahim Lodhi, remained in power there for 
nine more years, finally being defeated at the 
Battle of Panipat in 1526. Between 1540 and 1556,
 Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri ruled the
 area. It achieved fame as the capital of the Mughal 
Empire from 1556 to 1658.
