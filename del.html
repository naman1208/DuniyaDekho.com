Delhi  (also known as the National Capital Territory of India) 
is a metropolitan region in India that includes the national capital city, New Delhi. 
With a population of 22 million in 2011, it is the world's second most populous city 
 and the largest city in India in terms of area. The NCT and its urban region have been given the
 special status of National Capital Region (NCR) under the Constitution of India's 69th amendment act of 1991. The NCR includes the neighbouring cities of Baghpat, Gurgaon, Sonepat, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and other nearby towns, and has nearly 22.2 million residents.[5]
A federally administered union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more 
closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive 
council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal 
government of India and the local government of Delhi, and is the capital of the NCT of Delhi.
Delhi has been continuously inhabited since the 6th century BC. Through most of its history, Delhi has 
served as a capital of various kingdoms and empires. It has been captured, ransacked and rebuilt 
several times, particularly during the medieval period, and the modern Delhi is a cluster of a number 
of cities spread across the metropolitan region. This is why Delhi is sometimes called the
