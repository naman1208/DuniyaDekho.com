Mount Fuji, located on Honshu Island, is the highest mountain in Japan at 3,776.24 m <br>
(12,389 ft). An active stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707–08, Mount Fuji lies about <br>
100 kilometres (60 mi) south-west of Tokyo, and can be seen from there on a clear day.<br>
 Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is snow-capped several months a <br>
year, is a well-known symbol of Japan
 and it is frequently depicted in art and <br>
photographs, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers. It is one of Japan's Special<br>
 "Three Holy Mountains"  along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku; it is a Place of<br>
 Scenic Beauty, a Historic Site, and was added to the World Heritage List as a <br>
Cultural Site on June 22nd, 2013.

It is thought that the first ascent was in 663 by an anonymous monk.[citation needed] <br>
The summit has been thought of as sacred since ancient times and was forbidden to <br>women
 until the Meiji Era. Ancient samurai
 used the base of the mountain as a remote <br>training area,
 near the present day town of Gotemba. The shogun Minamoto no Yoritomo<br> held yabusame in the
 area in the early Kamakura period.
