Kerala , regionally referred to as Keralam , is a state in the south-west region of India on the Malabar 
It was formed on 1 November 1956 as per the States Reorganisation Act by combining various 
Malayalam-speaking regions. 
Spread over 38,863 km2  it is bordered by Karnataka to the north and north east, Tamil Nadu to the east and
 south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 census,
 Kerala is the twelfth largest state by population and is divided into 14 districts.
 Malayalam  is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. 
The state capital is Thiruvananthapuram, other major cities include Kochi, Kozhikode, Thrissur, and Kollam.
The region was a prominent spice exporter from 3000 BCE to 3rd century. 
The Chera Dynasty was the first powerful kingdom based in Kerala, though it frequently struggled against 
attacks from the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas. During the Chera period Kerala remained an international
 spice trading center. Later, in the 15th century, the lucrative spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to 
Kerala, and eventually paved the way for the European colonisation of the whole of India. 
After independence, Travancore and Cochin joined the Republic of India.
