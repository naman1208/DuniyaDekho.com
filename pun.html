larger Punjab region. The state is bordered by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh to the east, 
Haryana to the south and southeast and pnjasthan to the southwest as well as the Pakistani province 
of Punjab to the west. It is also bounded to the north by the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. 
The state capital is located in Chandigarh, which is a Union Territory and also the capital of the
 neighbouring state of Haryana.
After the partition of India in 1947, the Punjab province of British India was divided between India 
and Pakistan. The Indian Punjab was divided in 1966 with the formation of the new states of Haryana 
and Himachal Pradesh, as well as the current state of Punjab. Punjab is the only state in India 
with a majority Sikh population.
