Rajasthan , known as "the land of kings", 
is the largest state of the Republic of India by area. 
It is located in the west of India. It comprises most of the area of the large, inhospitable Thar Desert, 
also known as the Great Indian Desert, which parallels the Sutlej-Indus river valley along its border
 with Pakistan to the west. Rajasthan is also bordered by Gujarat to the southwest, Madhya Pradesh to t
he southeast, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to the northeast and Punjab to the north. Rajasthan covers 
10.4% of India, an area of 342,239 square kilometres (132,139 sq mi).
Jaipur is the capital and the largest city of the state.

Geographical features include the Thar Desert 
along north-western Rajasthan and the termination of the Ghaggar River near the archaeological 
ruins at Kalibanga of the Indus Valley Civilization, which are the oldest in the Indian subcontinent discovered
 so far.
One of the world's oldest mountain ranges, the Aravalli Range, cradles the only hill station of Rajasthan,
 Mount Abu, famous for Dilwara Temples, a sacred pilgrimage for Jains. Eastern Rajasthan has the world 
famous Keoladeo National Park near Bharatpur, a World Heritage Site  known for its bird life. 
It also has two national tiger reserves, Ranthambore and Sariska Tiger Reserve.
Rajasthan was formed on 30 March 1949, when the region known until then as Rajputana, consisting
 of erstwhile princely states ruled by Meenas, Rajputs, Jats, Gurjars, and Muslims, merged into the
 Dominion of India<B>.
