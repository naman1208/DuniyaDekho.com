 Emirates, and is the tallest man-made structure in the world, at 829.8 m (2,722 ft).
Construction began on 21 September 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009. 
<br><br><br><br><br><br>The building officially opened on 4 January 2010, and is part of the new 2 km2 (490-acre) development called<
 Downtown Dubai at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district.
<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill ofChicago, with Adrian
 Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as chief structural engineer. The primary contractor was Samsung C&T ofSouth Korea
Burj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development that would include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19
 residential towers,the Dubai Mall, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) man-made Burj Khalifa Lake.
The building has returned the location of Earth's tallest freestanding structure to the Middle East, where the Great Pyramid of Giza had claimed this achievement for almost four millennia before being surpassed in 1311 by
 Lincoln Cathedral in England.
