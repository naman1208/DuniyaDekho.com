Niagara Falls  is the collective name for three waterfalls that straddle the international border between 
Canada and the United States; more specifically, between the province of Ontario and the state of New York.
 They form the southern end of the Niagara Gorge.
From largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the Bridal 
Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls lie on the Canadian side and the American Falls on the American side,
 separated by Goat Island. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also located on the American side, separated 
from the other waterfalls by Luna Island. The international boundary line was originally drawn through 
Horseshoe Falls in 1819, but the boundary has long been in dispute due to natural erosion and construction.
