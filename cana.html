 Mountain Trench of British Columbia. The southern end bordersIdaho and Montana of the USA.
 The northern end is at the Liard River in northern British Columbia.
The Canadian Rockies have numerous high peaks and ranges, such as Mount Robson (3,954 m (12,972 ft))
 and Mount Columbia (3,747 m (12,293 ft)). The Canadian Rockies are composed of shale and limestone.
